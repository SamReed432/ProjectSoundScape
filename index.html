<h5>About Project SoundScape</h5>
<p class="description">In homes and exhibits, spatial audio systems are used to simulate directional sounds to enhance the immersiveness of an experience. These systems rely upon the creation of virtual sources, audio that sounds like its coming from a point in thin air. In order to perceive these virtual sources you need to sit in the “sweet-spot”: the location equidistant from all speakers.   As soon as you move from the sweet spot, these virtual sources begin to collapse to the nearest speaker and their position is no longer as intended. 
  Project Soundscape seeks to alleviate the need for a single sweet-spot; By compensating for the listener’s position we can keep the virtual sources always in their intended locations. This creates a soundscape: a digitally crafted sound environment that you can physically walk through. You can create a soundscape by providing a sound, and defining how that sound should move throughout the room over time, and then running the experience in our dedicated room.
  
  In a typical spatial audio setup, in order to experience virtual sources, you need to be in the sweet-spot, the place where both speakers reach you at the same time and volume. When this occurs, there is an illusion of a single source in between the two speakers. 
  However, as you move, the speakers no longer reach you at the same time and volume causing the virtual source to move with you.
